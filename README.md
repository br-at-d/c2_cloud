# c2_cloud

Forked from https://github.com/GoVanguard/c2_cloud 

This will download and configure the Hak5 C2 Cloud Community edition server for most Linux systems with TLS enabled via Letâ€™s Encrypt. 
The install script allows for the customization all the C2 settings, as well as accepting the defaults.

Currently the setup process is configured to run the C2 server on a Raspberry Pi 3 (c2_community-linux-armv7), however this can easily be changed by editing c2_start.sh to use the C2 server version of your choice.

Setup has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ running DietPi v6.25.3 (https://dietpi.com)
